# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
Louise wants to know how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and funding goals, after her play <i>Fever</i> came close to its fundraising goal in a short amount of time. The campaign outcomes have been visualized based on launched dates and funding goals, and below is the analysis of the project. 

### Purpose

The purpose of this project is to analyze the Kickstarter data and see how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and funding goals. Using the Kickstarter data, campaign outcomes were visualized based on launch dates and funding goals, and below is the analysis of the two charts. 

## Analysis and Challenges

From the two charts below we can see that the most successful month for theater campaigns is May. We can also see that the amount of canceled theater campaigns is relatively low compared to the amount of failed campaigns. Based on goals, we can see that zero percent of the campaigns for plays were canceled, and nearly 80% of campaigns with goals less than 1000 were funded.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

The biggest challenge for me was figuring out the readme file and how to use it. As I've never used GitHub or done any sort of coding before, I was very lost. Thankfully I am in a study group, and one of the members, Tana, who had already figured out the readme file was able to assist. Between her help with the deliverable requirements and Google, I believe I am slowly learning how to utilize readme files properly. 

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

    - The month of May was the most successful launch date for theater.
    
    - There were more successful launches than failed or canceled launches for theater. 

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

    - There was a higher percentage of successful play launches than failed play launches. 
  
- What are some limitations of this dataset?

    - We aren't able to track the success rates of the plays over time, if they stayed open after they launched, or if they closed after a two week run. We    also aren't able to verify if the same commitments went into each campaign that could have attributed to their successful, failed, or canceled launched.
  
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

    - If we filtered the data down further by country, it would be helpful to see a stacked bar graph of successful play launches so we could see what countries were most successful. Then we could also apply the same filter and look at failed and canceled play launches by country, to have a better understanding of where Kickstarter campaigns for plays are the most successful.
